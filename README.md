# Description
Extends cloudbees/jnlp-slave-with-java-build-tools so it can be used as a Jenkins JLNP slave, for use with Jenkins Cloud plugins.

See README for details on available tools.

# How to use this Docker image

This Docker image is intended to be used in conjunction with a Docker container orchestration service such as
- Amazon EC2 Container Service
It can also be used "static" Jenkins slave connected to a Jenkins master declaring a JNLP slave but it would require to manually launch the Docker container.

# Running
To run a Docker container

docker run maathor/jnlp-slave-with-python2-kafka-build-tools -url http://jenkins-server:port <secret> <slave name>

optional environment variables:

- JENKINS_URL: url for the Jenkins server, can be used as a replacement to -url option, or to set alternate jenkins URL
- JENKINS_TUNNEL: (HOST:PORT) connect to this slave host and port instead of Jenkins server, assuming this one do route TCP traffic to Jenkins master. Useful when when Jenkins runs behind a load balancer, reverse proxy, etc.
